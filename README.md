## How The Play Roulette Game Works

<p>In a play-roulette, players place their bets on a table with numbers and betting options. The table corresponds to a spinning wheel with numbered pockets, which is spun by the dealer. Once the ball comes to a stop in one of the pockets, the dealer announces the winning number and pays out any winning bets.</p>

<p>Players can bet on a variety of options, including specific numbers or groups of numbers, such as whether the ball will land on an odd or even number or on a red or black pocket. </p>
